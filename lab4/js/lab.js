// Creating a checkers game:
// Print out a board
// Place pieces on board
    // 12 black pieces
    // 12 white pieces
// Validated users color
// Black goes first
// Validate users move
    // Pieces can only move diagonally forward
// Capture opponent's checker by jumping adjacent checkers
// When a checker reaches the first row it becomes a king
    // Checker can now move diagonally forward or backwards
//First to capture all of opponents checker wins
