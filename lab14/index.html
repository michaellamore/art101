      <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p> From the last lecture, we learned better ways of debugging code. For this lab, we use that debugging knowledge to fix and change an old lab. </p>

      <p> I wanted to work on my lab 6. I didn't (and still don't) understand the purpose of writeln. Instead, I wanted to get the element id of a div and then output it onto the html file. I also experimented with console.logs and adding multilple of them to see if an error would popup in any of my code.  </p>

      <p> I was able to output everything in myTransport and myRide using jQuery. It was much easier to follow and understand rather than writeln. Also, opening up the console, you could see what my arrays are, and the for-loops I used in order to add them to the HTML. That way, if something went wrong, you would be able to pinpoint where it occured. </p>
