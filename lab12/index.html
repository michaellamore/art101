  <h1> Lab 12: Conditionals </h1>

  <section id="challenge">
    <div id="challengeContainer">
      <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p> This lab is all about learning how to use conditionals to do specific things in the code. This lab also makes us use jQuery a little more because we have to append things onto the HTML through the JS again. </p>

      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p> I didn't have any major problems. Some minor hiccups, however, included me forgetting to add the "#" sign whenever I try and find a div using jQuery. Some of the bonus tasks were a bit confusing, but I still tried doing some of them. There were also a couple of edge cases that I needed to solve. If the user didn't put anything in the input field they would still be able to submit and see which house they got. Another one was continously appending new p tags rather than overriding the existing p tag. </p>

      <h2> Results </h2>
      <p> As you can see, I was able to do what the lab asked me to. The code appends h3 tags and p tags for the house, and its description. It is also scalable, meaning that you could technically keep adding more and more house names and it would still work. Descriptions are limited, however, so new houses will just have the same descriptions. Not only did I learn more about if-statements, but I also experimented with switch cases. <br/><br/> Try it out for yourself! </p>
