		<h2 id="lab-header"> Challenge </h2>

		<p> The goal of Lab 5 is to experiment the basics of JavaScript's data types and using variables. This lab also teaches us how to reference our JavaScript file within HTML. </p>

		<h2 id="lab-header"> Problems </h2>

		<p> Everything in this lab was easy to do because of the clear instructions. The only part I was confused about was whether or not I should be using 'let', 'var', 'const', or nothing at all when creating and assigning my variables. The instructions say to use var, but the example images do not use any. From my own research and understanding, after the introduction of 'let' and 'const', it is good practice to use 'let' because of its scope. I use let instead of const in-case I have to change the value of my variables, whereas const will create variables that cannot be changed. In this particular lab, none of it really matters, but I just wanted to think about these things. </p>

		<h2 id="lab-header"> Results </h2>

		<p> As you can see, everything works flawlessly. I was able to properly format the JavaScript file and reference it within the HTML, and also made the webpage look decent. </p>
