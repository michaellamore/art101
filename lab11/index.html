  <h1> Lab 11: Libraries and jQuery </h1>

      <h2> Challenge </h2>
      <p> For this lab, we experimented with jQuery to add buttons, rather than using .getElementById. We also practiced adding event listeners to buttons again.  </p>

      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p> This was my first time using a JS library, so it was interesting to learn about jQuery. I had a bit of trouble learning what I can do using jQuery, but I read through a little bit of the documentation and I was able to pick it up at a super basic level. </p>

      <h2> Results </h2>
      <p> As you can see, I was able to create the buttons correctly using jQuery. At first, I manually typed out each of the functions. Instead of typing each of the jQuery stuff out, I decided to just use a for loop and an array of Div IDs so that I don't have to reuse the same code. My custom functions can technically be done to an infinite amount of divs, as long as you put in the correct Div ID in the array. </p>
