  		<h2 id="lab-header"> Challenge </h2>
  		<p> This lab is all about learning how to write functions, take user input, manipulate strings, as well as adding it onto the document. We also learned how to create our lab files from scratch. </p>

  		<h2 id="lab-header"> Problems </h2>
  		<p> The lab itself was straight forward enough, but the bonus tasks were quite tricky for me personally. I had a hard time figuring out how to let sort pay attention to lower and uppercase letters. I was unable to turn the username into an anagram, nor was I able to capitalize words correctly or omit spaces.  </p>

  		<h2 id="lab-header"> Results </h2>
  		<p> I changed the way I output the text and the sorted name by adding divs, tags, etc. through JavaScript, instead of using document.writeln(). This is so that I have a bit more freedom with what I want to do with the css, and I wanted to learn how to add elements to HTML using JS. I learned how to let sort see uppercase and lowercase letters as well as making the window.prompt go outside of the functions. I didn't have the time to do the other extra tasks, however.  </p>
