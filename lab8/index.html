  		<h2 id="lab-header"> Challenge </h2>
  		<p> This lab is all about learning how to use anon functions as well as learning what callbacks are/an example of how to do it. It also teaches us how to implement that into the console as well as on the HTML (through the bonus task). </p>

  		<h2 id="lab-header"> Problems </h2>
  		<p> The lab itself was easy to follow because the instructions were very clear. I tried doing the bonus task, and I wanted to push myself by learning how to create unordered lists and adding array elements into that list strictly through JavaScript. </p>

  		<h2 id="lab-header"> Results </h2>
  		<p> As you can see, I was successfully able to output my JavaScript arrays, both in the console and the page itself. </p>
