	<div id="info">
		<h1> Challenge </h1>
		<p> This lab is all about training us to think in terms of pseudocoding before coding. Pseudocode is helpful for outlining what exactly the code needs to do to achieve a desired result.</p>

		<h1> Problems </h1>
		<p> A small hiccup I came across when working on the everyday task outline, was that I was not sure how to nest an ordered list within an ordered list. In the outline, I wanted 'major steps' and 'minor steps' to follow, which meant I needed to learn how to nest lists in HTML.<span id="names">- Michael</span></p>
		<p> I too had the same problem with creating a combined ordered list and an unordered list. I also had some problems making the outline easy to understand and organized as much as possible without being too detailed.<span id="names">- Jenna</span></p>

			<h3> Top-secret recipe to make crazy good orange chicken at home </h3>
			<ol id = "everyday-task-outline">
				<li> Make the sauce
					<ol>
						<li> Mix 3/4 cup of granulated sugar and 3/4 cup of white vinegar onto a heated saucepan. </li>
						<li> Add 1/3 cup + 1 tbsp of soy sauce and 1/4 cup of water onto the mixture. </li>
						<li> Add 1 orange's zest and juice, then mix. </li>
						<li> Once the sauce starts to boil over high heat, reduce the heat to medium. </li>
						<li> Let it simmer for 8-10 minutes. </li>
						<li> Separately, mix 1 tbsp of cornstarch with 1 tbsp of water, then whisk it into the saucepan. </li>
						<li> Let it simmer until the sauce thickens. </li>
						<li> Add some grated cloves of garlic and ginger, then let it steep. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Make the chicken
					<ol>
						<li> Combine 1 cup of cornstarch with 1/2 cup of flour onto a bowl. </li>
						<li> Whisk two eggs together in a separate bowl. </li>
						<li> Cut 1 + 1/2 lbs of chicken thighs into the bite-sized pieces, and lightly season with salt. </li>
						<li> Mix the chicken pieces onto the cornstarch and flour, then onto the eggs, and back onto the cornstarch mixture. </li>
						<li> Heat some oil until it is boiling hot, and fry the chicken pieces for 3-5 minutes until they are golden brown. </li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				<li> Combine the chicken with the sauce! </li>
			</ol>

		<p id="results">  As you can see, I was able to outline the everyday task within the html, and nest ordered lists within one another. I did this through the 'ol' tag and 'li' tags for each element within the list, and adding another 'ol' tag whenever I needed to nest a new list. I was also able to create a step-by-step process for creating orange chicken, outlined in a way that is similar to pseudocode for coding.<span id="names">- Michael<span></p>

		<p id="results"> I created a computer task of creating a checkers game. I figured out how to organize the list by using a "unordered list" with margin indents to create the outline "look and feel". I seperated the steps by important tasks and some with subtasks. I used my outline to then create a pseudocode and imbeded it from the JavaScript file.<span id="names">- Jenna</span></p>
