				My name is Michael Remorin and I am a 3rd year AGPM major. I grew up in the Philippines, though I've lived in
				Los Angeles for as long as I can remember. I enjoy taking pictures during my free time,
				focusing more on street and urban photography. While I was living on campus, I joined numerous clubs
				that piqued my interests such as photography, Muay Thai and also joined other organizations. Recently,
				I have been very interested in becoming a game developer and illustrator. I have made a couple of small
				games to learn how to code, though nothing I am too proud to show off yet. I have also been getting into
				learning how to draw digitally, though it has been a lengthy process. My major goal is to be good enough to draw
				and code to create a game that can entertain people, no matter how long it will take.
