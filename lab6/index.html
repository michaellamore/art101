		<h2 id="lab-header"> Challenge </h2>
		<p> The goal of Lab 6 is to experiment with JavaScript, implementing it within HTML/CSS, and using its array and object system. </p>

		<h2 id="lab-header"> Problems </h2>
		<p>
			The only issue I came across was trying to understand the difference in an array and an object within JavaScript. Even then, it was easy to understand once I did my own research and testing. The JSON part of the lab seems out of nowhere for me as well, and seems quite confusing as a beginner.
		</p>

		<h2 id="lab-header"> Results </h2>
		<p> I was able to successfully create arrays and objects through JavaScript, and I was also able to add them onto the webpage.  </p>
