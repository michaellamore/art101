      <h2> Problems </h2>
      <p> For this lab, we were told on the assignment page that we had to use a .ajax() method in jQuery. I had a very hard time understanding how the .ajax() method worked in jQuery. Thankfully, Jenna was able to help me out and I was able to get ajax to work for my trivia button  </p>

      <p> Even if I had some issues, I just followed the documentation on the website itself. When you press the button below, you are given a random fact, curtesy of numbersapi.com. I chose to use one of the links that generate a random number and provide trivia for that specific number. I thought this was really interesting, and I can definitely see myself using this in the near future in personal projects and assignments.  </p>
